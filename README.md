Best Fit Model Output 

This directory contains the best fit model output for each GPS location. There are two subdirectories for RACMO and MAR. 

File format and naming:
The file naming convention is: site_SMBmodel_EBM_Lx_xexx.txt where site is the GPS site, E/M/B refers to Elastic, Maxwell or burgers rheology, L refers to the lithospheric thickness, xexx refers to the upper mantle viscosity in the format 2e19. Burgers models have two values, transient and steady-state viscosity respectively. 

The times steps are monthly.

Corrected GPS 
This directory contains GPS time series data that have been corrected for the best fitting viscoelastic (or elastic where that it the best fit) model output. There are two subdirectories for RACMO and MAR.
